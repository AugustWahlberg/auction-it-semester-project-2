# Project description
This is a school project in collaboration with Noroff. The website is an auction site where only @noroff.no mails can register and login. 
You do not need a actual noroff-mail to register. You can use a dummy email. Example: dummymail@noroff.no.
You can also visit the website without being logged in, but then will you have limited functionality. 

The project uses Vite as a bundler, and Tailwind with PostCSS as the CSS framework.

If you have any questions regarding the project, you can contact me on: aug.wahlberg@gmail.com
